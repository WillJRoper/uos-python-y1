    "## What are Packages?\n",
    "\n",
    "Packages are pieces of code that have been created by other developers that give Python more functions and abilities. They are generally open source, actively developed, and available for free. In serious programs they are indispensable! Replicating code that other people have already written is a pointless waste of time and money (if you're being employed). Often they will have been implemented in a far more memory and time-efficient way than would be possible without years of experience, possibly even interfacing with much faster C or C++ (`numpy` for instance) code under the hood.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A quick overview of packages: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Standard Python contains many built-in functions but does not contain everything you will need in your coding future.\n",
    "- Packages can be loaded by Python and contain dozens of functions.\n",
    "- Occasionally (but rarely, this is mostly avoided) function names are duplicated in different packages. Even though they share a name, the operation of these functions could be very different. You, therefore, have to be careful to use the correct version (by specifying the module name explicitly in the function call, this will become obvious below).\n",
    "- You should only import the packages that you **need**, and only import them once (loading packages multiple times and/or loading packages you don't need leads to wasted memory)."

These packages in fact contain \"methods\" and functions, the distinction will make far more sense if you progress to object-orientated programming. For simplicity we will use the two interchangeably, mainly focusing on misusing \"function\" for simplicity's sake but don't be confused if you come across \"method\" in the future or online.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Common Python packages\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some common packages we will cover in this course (in no particular order): \n",
    "- `matplotlib`: Includes graphics tools to create and display plots. In Physics and Astrophysics, it is frequently used to make plots for publications.\n",
    "- `numpy`: Includes data structures (arrays) and mathematical operations not included in basic Python, for example, cosine, exponentials, logarithms, etc. Some basics of `numpy` will be discussed in this section, but we will comprehensively cover it in a future notebook. `numpy` can be extremely helpful for speeding up your programs since many of its operations are implemented in C behind the scenes\n",
    "- `scipy`: Includes scientific resources such as those needed in mathematical physics, e.g., Bessel, gamma, beta functions, signal processing, integration, differential equation solving, and statistics... (you will use `scipy` a **lot** in Scientific Computing in Y2).\n",
    "- `random`: Can be used to generate pseudo-random numbers.\n",
    "- `pandas`: Allows you to work with data in a structure analogous to spreadsheets. We will cover this in detail later.\n",
    "- `os`: allows you to interface Python with your operating system (via Unix commands, sorry Windows users), for example, if you want to load up certain types of files into your Python code or change directories.\n",
    "- `math`: Includes basic math operations, much the same as `numpy`, but will only accept singular values to most of its functions. This limitation means we will use it rarely but sometimes we will need it for specific functionality.\n",
    "- `unyt`: Allows you to work with units and directly import constants inside your code directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are some additional packages that you may come across, especially if you are working on your own projects. **NOTE: Although it is absolutely fine to use these or other non-standard packages, do not use them in the assessments. We will only mark work that uses the taught methods.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `TkInter`: A way to use GUIs with Python.\n",
    "- `PyGame`: If you are writing games.\n",
    "- `SQLAlchemy`: If you want to set up a database.\n",
    "- `SymPy`: Symbolic equation solving in Python, this is essentially free Maple.\n",
    "- `time`: Amongst other things, this contains a useful function to check how long your code is taking to run.\n",
    "- `html`: Write webpages in python.\n",
    "- `astropy`: If you are lucky enough to do any astronomy research, then you'll definitely be using this one. It contains its own implementation of units as well as all the machinery to do cosmological calculations.\n",
    "- `scikit learn`: A suite of simple machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "- `tensorflow`: A more in-depth module filled with machine learning \"machinery\", including lots of GPU optimisation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find many more packages described online, e.g. check out [https://wiki.python.org/moin/UsefulModules](https://wiki.python.org/moin/UsefulModules)."
