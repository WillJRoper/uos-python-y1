    "Up until now, we've mainly worked with variables that contain single entities in the form of integers, floats, and strings (although strings are technically arrays of multiple characters). You may have wondered what's so great about Python after seeing the past few notebooks and I wouldn't blame you. We've essentially used it like a glorified calculator and text manipulator, all with much more complexity than is necessary for those simple jobs. The fact of the matter is we barely scratched the surface thus far. \n",
    "\n",
    "When we work in Python we are rarely working on variables containing single entities. Instead, we are working on collections of data stored in data structures. This data could be derived from an experiment or arrays of values derived empirically. No matter how it is derived things get much more interesting when your variables contain multiple values. \n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest forms of data structures in Python are lists and tuples. Any Python object can be stored in a list or tuple. That includes other lists and tuples, so it is possible (and sometimes useful) to have a list of lists. \n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned in [notebook 1](1_the_basics.ipynb), lists and tuples are essentially the same; the key difference is that lists are mutable (editable) and tuples immutable (are not editable). \n",

    "Above is a diagram showing the anatomy of Python Tuples and Lists. Lists, tuples, and strings all have the same index conventions where the first element is the zeroth element. The way a list is differentiated from a tuple is the symbol used to denote the beginning and end of each; for a list `[]` and for a tuple `()`. We refer to each value stored at an index as an element. The value stored at index 0 is the zeroth element and the value stored at index $n$ is $n$th element."
