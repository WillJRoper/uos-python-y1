    "- A **script** is a single file containing code that does something (not necessarily Python). We'll focus on notebooks in this course but if you write some stand-alone code to run on the command line you would write a `my_py_script.py` file and run this \"script\" on the command line by invoking `python my_py_script.py`. These Python files do not have cells, when you run the script the whole script is run from top to bottom.\n",
    "- A **notebook** is a single file containing a mixture of code and text \"cells\". You are in one currently so this should come as no surprise. Notebooks are extremely useful if you want to rerun individual cells of code without rerunning previously run code in other cells or if you need to present information alongside your code, like when writing a course teaching Python or an assessment for instance...\n",
    "- A **variable** is exactly what you think it is: a name representing a value. More specifically in code, a variable represents a value stored at a particular address in the memory of your computer. This distinction is unimportant in Python but still worth knowing.\n",
    "- An **operator** is a symbol which acts on a variable in some way. Much like in mathematics `+`, `-`, `*` etc are all operators. However, in coding `=` is also an operator, specifically the \"assignment\" operator. There are many operators, so many I'm not convinced I will cover an exhaustive list during this course or that I know all of them in the first place.\n",
    "- A **comment** is a piece of descriptive \"code\" that is not executed (i.e. does nothing). More on this below.\n",
    "- A **line** is self-explanatory, it's a single line of code.\n",

    "## Variables and Data types in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In coding, variables are used to store information and give it a descriptive label (the variable name). Python variables can have many different data types, the most common of which are:\n",
    "- Integer - These are just integer numbers $(\\mathbb{Z})$ such as 1, 53, 8651247 etc.\n",
    "- Floats - These represent the real numbers $(\\mathbb{R})$ to a certain precision. Integers, fractions, and irrational numbers can all be stored as floats. E.g, 2.0, 12.5, 6.3215314, $\\pi$ etc.\n",
    "- Complex - These are complex numbers $(\\mathbb{C})$, of the form: a+b$i$, 3+5$i$, 7-4$i$ etc. You should have used these in your maths course. **Note: In Python the complex number $i$ is represented with $j$, following the engineering convention.** We will barely use these but they are good to know about.\n",
    "- Strings - These are a sequence of characters. You set the beginning and end of the sequence by enclosing the characters in quotation marks, e.g. `Hello', ``F\", `This is also a string'. **Note: The quotation marks can be double or single. Choose a convention and stick with it. My personal convention, due to apostrophes, is to use ``double quotation marks\" but neither is incorrect.**\n",
    "- Boolean - These represent the two values of Boolean logic, True or False.\n",
    "- Lists - These contain multiple elements and can be different data types. They are also mutable, a concept we will cover shortly. \n",
    "- Tuples - Tuples are the same as lists in most respects. However, they are **immutable*, again, more on this later.\n",
    "- Dictionaries - This data type contains a set of key:value pairs, with the value being mapped to a *unique* key. Like lists, they are mutable. These are one of the most powerful tools in Python and will be covered in a later practical session.\n",
    "- Sets - These are like lists in that they store a collection of values but for sets only a single instance of a value can exist in a set, i.e. any value in a set is guaranteed to be unique. Like dictionaries, these can be incredibly powerful but we will not use them explicitly in this module.\n",

    "\n",
    "As I've said, we'll be using notebooks exclusively for this module but if you want to write your own Python scripts you'll want a piece of software in which to write them. Software used for this purpose is called Integrated Development Environments or IDEs.\n",
    "\n",
    "A loose definition of an IDE might be \"a piece of software that provides everything a user needs to write code\". They are essentially text editors with extra functionality. IDEs exist for every programming language, and normally include (at the very least):\n",
    "- A source code editor - Lets the user write and edit their code.\n",
    "- A debugger - Tools to check for issues with the code.\n",
    " - A compiler - This assembles and runs the code. Different types of programming languages approach this differently; languages like C or C++ have to be compiled (like assembling a machine before you use it) into an `executable' before they're run. Python, on the other hand, is an interpreted language and is executed line-by-line (like reading a recipe and doing as instructed on each line).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a huge number of IDEs to choose from, especially for a popular language such as Python, and ultimately you just have to try a few until you find your favourite. We will summarise a few of the most popular options here, and if you're interested in the subject you can do your own research. Many IDEs are free, but those that do charge often have a student discount option, so look out for that.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Text Editors - Although not technically IDEs, text editors like Notepad and Gedit get an honorable mention as you can write code in them and then run it from the terminal. For instance, you could write `print(\"hello world\")` in a file called test.py, save it, and then run it by typing `python test.py` in terminal.\n",
    "- VSCode - is now widely used due to its simplicity and the \"ease\" with which it can be customised. One bonus of VScode is it has a very nice interface to interact with Jupyter Notebooks so could be used for this module! I personally don't use it but many do and it is very good with a relatively small learning curve and lots of videos and documents online to learn how to use it.\n",
    "- Spyder - A more traditional Python IDE packaged with Anaconda, with some more features. It works for some, but I would not personally recommend it.\n",
    "- PyCharm - This was my personal favourite IDE until a few years ago. It has basically every feature you can ever imagine needing. There is a free version and a paid professional version (though students can get both for free). It requires a relatively good computer to run it, otherwise, it can be a little laggy. The reason I no longer recommend it is the learning curve is steeper than others and VSCodes improvements have outstripped PyCharm. (PyCharm's Jupyter Notebook interface is also plain horrible.) That said, if you want a fully featured IDE and are willing to learn a bit it is still very good.\n",
    "- Command line editors - Many choose to use text editors written in the 70s, 80s, and early 90s. Examples of these are `vim`, `emacs`, and `nano`. Nano is awful, do not consider it! Vim and Emacs are fantastic though. I personally use Emacs with a Vim plugin to use the best of both worlds. These are infinitely customisable and provide methods for editing text that outstrip anything a modern editor can provide. So, do I recommend using one now? Absolutely **NOT**!! The learning curve for these is astronomical. Even exiting Vim is a challenge that has become a meme online. However, I highlight that they exist because learning to use one can be a huge boon in productivity in the future and also earns you \"god-like\" status amongst programmers.\n",
