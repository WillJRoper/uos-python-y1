In addition, the last [notebook](8_pandas.ipynb) already showed an example of the scatter plot function. In this notebook we will expand on this, showing some basic tools for handling and fitting data in Python with the help of `pandas` to interface with data.\n",

    "However, to begin with we are going to create some random data to plot. Unlike the random numbers we have generated previously, here we will use the `numpy.random` sub-module. We will cover this in greater detail in future notebooks. The reason for the switch up is that we now want multiple of random values not just individual values. This is much more easily achieved with `numpy` than `random`."
