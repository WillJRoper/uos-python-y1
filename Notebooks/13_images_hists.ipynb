To make a histogram you need to sort data into a set of bins. In Python there are a number of ways to produce histograms, here I will show the `numpy` method, there is nothing wrong with any other method and the `matplotlib` method is similar and produces a plot at the same time, but I feel the `numpy` method provides a bit more flexibility before plotting.\n",
