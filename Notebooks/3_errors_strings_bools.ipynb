    "By the end of this notebook, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand Python Errors.\n",
    "- Manipulate strings.\n",
    "- Use Boolean variables.\n",
    "- Use the `input` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous notebook, we learned about data types, mathematical operations in Python, and commenting. In this notebook, we'll move beyond using Python as a glorified calculator and you'll be introduced to errors (how Python tells you something has gone wrong), strings (a non-numeric data type), and booleans (true and false values). Things are starting out slow now, but as we progress things will get more complex and the power of Python will become evident. But first...\n",

    "By all means work together on the exercises during the lab sessions, and by all means *talk* to each other about ways to approach the assessments. However, if find yourself de-bugging a friend's code for an assessment, you've gone too far -  you've got to let them figure this stuff out themselves. If you find yourself cutting and pasting from a friend's code, then that's even more serious. If incidences of plagiarism and collusion do come to light, (and they have in the past, it's always obvious) those involved will be referred to the appropriate disciplinary committee. \n",

    "## Sourcing Help\n",
    "\n",
    "When coding, in this module or in the future, you may run into concepts you don't understand, inexplicable errors, or wonder what the best approach to a problem is. By all means, ask me or the ATs for help but you should also be aware of the wealth of tools on the internet. \n",
    "- [Stack Overflow](www.stackoverflow.com) is a community-driven forum where people post their problems and users attempt to provide solutions. If you run into a problem it's almost certain that somebody else has already had it, and asked about it somewhere on the internet, so it's worth having a look.\n",
    "- Simply googling \"\\<thing I am currently doing\\> in Python\" (e.g. \"String splitting in Python\") will give you a treasure trove of information from the basic to the intensely complex. Due to Python's popularity, there are helpful learning tools everywhere. In fact, googling something like this will normally result in top hits that link to Stack Overflow but there are also plenty of blogs and Python specific sites too.\n",
    "- And yes... the big baddy: **ChatGPT**. I'm sure most modules will tell you not to use it. I, on the other hand, highly recommend using it if you have an account or can make one. As a tool for coding it is amazing. Learning to use it effectively is an important skill and one which I'm sure is going to be ever more important in a decade's time. You can ask it to clarify concepts, show you example code for doing something, and tailor its responses to your level. That said, **don't be tempted to use it for assessments!** It is highly fallible, and will readily give you \"working\" code that isn't quite right in some subtle way. It also tends to give code with certain odd quirks that are easily spotted. Moreover, you aren't really gaining knowledge if you just let chatGPT do your assessments. TL;DR: it's a fantastic **tool** for learning, finding information, and clarifying concepts (think google on steroids) but a rubbish tool for **doing**."

Bear in mind that restart and clear all will remove all of your `Out` cells.
