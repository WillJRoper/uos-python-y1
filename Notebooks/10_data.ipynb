    "In the following notebooks we'll delve into some important concepts and use cases which you'll see throughout your degree and beyond. Before that, we'll cover some more common data formats and how to open them in Python. We've already seen CSV files and opened them with `pandas`, but there are many more data formats and CSV files are often cumbersome depending on your use case.\n",

    "Regardless of what field you end up specialising in it's certain you'll be handling data in a range of different formats. There is an assortment of standard formats in addition to CSV files, including text files, `pickle` files, `numpy` files, fits files and hdf5 files. There are also a plethora of other formats used in specifics fields for specific functions; for instance the Met Office use a data format modelled after HDF5 files called netCDF4 files which they use for storing weather data.\n",

    "\n",
    "One of the most frustrating things you can encounter is when you've spent hours running code to make some output file only for it to become corrupted due to careless handling down line. This isn't a big deal for a file which is backed up or can easily be reproduced but in many instances you might be working with a one off file containing terabytes of data which took days, if not weeks or months, to produce. It is therefore very important to learn how to correctly handle data files. The most important thing to remember is if you have opened a file you must close it! Many data files will allow you to do this manually with some form of `close` function. For instance in HDF5 you can open and close a file like this:\n"

In fact, `pandas` handles the opening and closing of files itself behind the scenes, a file is opened, parsed creating the dataframe, and then closed.\n",
