    "# Manipulating data in CSV files\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook you should:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Be familiar with CSV files.\n",
    "- Be able to load them with the `csv` package.\n",
    "- Be familiar with the `pandas` package.\n",
    "- Be able to perform simple manipulation of pandas DataFrames.\n",
    "- Be able to make intermediate level plots (including adding error bars).\n",
    "\n",
    "We now have *almost* all the moving parts to start analysing data in Python. The only missing ingredient is a method to load real data without typing it all out into lists! There's a myriad of different data formats we can inteface with Python, some of which we will cover later in the course (of course). \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we'll utilise CSV files. These are Comma Separated Values files. Essentially tables of values with each row on a new line and each value split by a \",\". CSV files are a standard format widely used for small datasets due to their simplicity. You will be familiar with spreadsheets in Excel, Excel can both read CSV files and write spreadsheets to them. In fact, at their root, spreadsheets really are just CSV files. Here is a really simple example of a CSV file just so you can see the structure.\n",

    "2, 80, 2\n",
    "3, 60, 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, they quickly become difficult to parse by eye. Below we'll learn how to load these files, make them more readable, and manipulate the data within them to make plots and get results. In future PIP Lab sessions you'll be able to take your data in Excel and then save it to a CSV for analysis in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you continue, you will need to download the `PythonExampleCSVfile1.csv`` file in order to complete the exercises below. The file can be found on Canvas in \"The Python Notebooks\" and in the GitHub repo, if you cloned it you already have the files in the \"data\" directory.\n"

    "## Loading CSV files\n",
    "\n",
    "Navigate to the CSV file you downloaded (or the one in repo) and double click it. This will open the file in your spreadsheet software (probably Excel but could be Numbers on Mac). You can now see the sort of information it contains. This file was generated by a PhD student, and contains real Astronomy research data - however, for these exercises, the meaning of the data is less important than the methods for accessing and manipulating it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Specifying Directories\n",
    "\n",
    "Just a quick aside on directory paths before we start using them:\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, when on university computers, the file path to a file in the Downloads, Desktop, or Documents directories are, respectively:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "C://Users/<insert username>/Downloads/<insert filename>\n",
    "C://Users/<insert username>/Desktop/<insert filename>\n",
    "C://Users/<insert username>/Documents/<insert filename>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the \"address\" the file. You can point to anywhere on your computer from anywhere by defining \"absolute\" paths like this. An absolute path contains the full address of a file from the root directory (here `Users`). There are also relative paths. These are paths that start from where you currently are. For instance the relative path of `file2.txt` in `Documents` from `Downloads` would be `../Documents/file2.txt`, where the `../` moves \"up a directory\". Look at the paths above to understand this, both `Documents` and `Downloads` are in the same parent directory so we first need to move \"up from `Downloads` and then into `Documents`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will be similar on your personal computers but not exactly the same. Have a look at the filepath displayed for the file, and then copy this into the path variable as shown above.\n"

    "### The csv package\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has a built in module for accessing the data in CSV files. We will cover this here but in the future you'll likely use the more robust `pandas` module we'll cover shortly. To import the `csv`` module we'll use the techniques covered in [the packages notebook](6_packages.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "Just to drive it home: Remember that you should always load your modules at the start of your code (i.e  in the first Jupyter cell) and only load a given module once. In these notebooks I'll break a lot of rules for the sake of demonstration. \n",
    "\n",
    "Below I will use the \"data\" directory in the repo in all examples since that is where I have stored the data. **You will need to modify these paths to point to where you have the data stored.** I will use `../` to move \"up a directory\" as described above, since the data directory is in the same parent directory as the \"Notebooks\" directory. \n"

    "- The `with` statement is similar to an `if` statement or `for` loop, in that you need to indent blocks of code underneath it to tell Python what should be done with the `with`. Think of the `with` statement as meaning *'with this item do the following`*, where the \"item\" above is the CSV file stored in the `myfile` variable and the \"following\" is the code block indented underneath. Normally the item is a file like we have here, because we want to make sure we close a file when we are done with it. A `with` does this automatically so we don't need to worry about it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\item The `open` command, unsurpirsingly, opens a file (this works for any file not just CSVs). `open` takes a string argument for the file path (but note that you could use a variable that has been set to the filename). The `\"r\"` that comes after the filename defines the *mode* of the file. In this case the `\"r\"` mode tells Python to read the file. If we had chosen `\"w\"` that would tell Python to \"write\" to the file, but don't do that... it'll overwrite the data in the file!\n",

    "- The `as myfile` assigns the opened file returned by `open` to the variable `myfile`.\n",

Just to be absolutely clear (and drive home an earlier point from [the variables section of notebook 1](1_the_basics.ipynb): The variable names `myfile`, `mydata``, and `myrow`) are irrelevant, they are just names, e.g. even if you changed the code to say `mycolumn`, the data would still be read in as rows. \n",

    "This is a really nice interface to quickly get plots out of a DataFrame but, in my opinion, the moment you try to do anything more complex than a simple plot like this its nicer to use the `matplotlib` interface itself rather than this `pandas` helper function. I feel it gives you more control and the code is more readable. However, if you look at [the docs](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.plot.html) for `Dataframe.plot` you'll see there are tons of possible arguments to control a myriad of plot properties. You can really get into the weeds and make complex plots if you wanted!"
