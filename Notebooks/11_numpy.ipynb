    "- Basic mathematical functions. \n",
    "- A whole host of common linear algebra operations.\n",
    "- A data structure that makes many complex operations simple. \n",
    "- Random number capabilities to name a few.\n",

Arrays however not only allow you to extract rows and columns but contain a large number of useful features.  \n"
