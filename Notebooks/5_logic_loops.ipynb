    "## Colons and Indentation\n",
    "\n",
    "Two important aspects of coding are indentation and colons, these help tell the program which parts of the code belong together when it comes to loops and if statements. These are not common to all programming languages (some use curly braces instead of indentation but often style dictates the necessity for indentation in addition to curly braces), but in Python they are vital for conditional statements, loops, and function definitions; three of the most important tools in programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "###Â Anatomy of Colons and Indentation\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img width=800 src=\"../Figures/anatomyOfColonindent.png\"></center>\n",
    "Above is a diagram showing the general form of a snippet of Python code using colons and indentation. Note: (as mentioned later) You can't mix whitespaces and tab indents, they are purely here for illustration.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Colons** are easy to forget, but are straightforward to use. You need to put one at the end of any Python command that is declaring a loop, condition (like an `if` statement), or function (as shown above). If you forget to do that the code won't run and you'll be given a `SyntaxError` at the location of the line that is lacking one.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Indents** are similarly easy to forget, and you'll usually get an error message that tells you where you've forgotten to put one if you run the code. However, when things get a bit more complex and you have multiple nested loops and conditions it can be very easy to mis-indent a block or statement. This can be problematic, either introducing minor undesirable behaviours into your program or a seriously detrimental bug. \n",
    "\n",
    "An indent is, by convention, 4 \"columns\" (\"white spaces\") wide for Python, though it is possible to use one tab character instead - **using both in one script will not work**. In general, Jupyter will add them for you if you've put a colon at the end of the previous line and then hit `Enter`. If you need to put them in yourself, we recommend  using the tab key (although that does not work in all editors), rather than counting the number of times you've hit the space bar (which becomes extremely tedious).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a line, or series of lines, of code is indented, it is referred to as a *block*. Like the blocks you have already seen without indentation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Learn to love indented code blocks: they are ubiquitous and powerful, and make the code more readable and easier to follow. Easily readable code is one of Python's main strengths and if you're ever handed a large program someone else has written you will truly begin to appreciate why this matters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Time for an anecdote: I once managed to make 12TB of data overnight by accidentally indenting a single line of code one step further than it should have been. This caused the University of Sussex's high performance computing (HPC) cluster to fill up overnight and induced mild panic in the department as everyone tried to clear unnecessary data out before important data was lost. So take this as a cautionary tale: **Check your indents**."

    "## The if statement and branching logic\n",
    "\n",
    "The `if` statement is a conditional construct. If a stated condition is met (is True), the code then executes a command or series of commands in the indented block following the colon. `if` statements are very useful and are used all the time in real codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three types of if statements that constitute \"branches\" of a logical expression, `if`, `elif`, and `else`. The `elif` statement is short for `else if`  and allows for another conditional statement to be added to an existing if statement. If the `if` condition is not met, then the elif condition is tested, if this `elif` condition is met then the `elif' block (statements indented below the `elif` condition) is executed. If the condition of the `elif` is not true then that code block is also skipped.  The `else` statement doesn't use an explicit condition (it has an implied condition simply meaning \"If none of the above was True\"). Below is a flowchart demonstrating this process.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img width=400 src=\"../Figures/if_elif_else_flowchart.png\"></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that you can have as many `elif` statements in an `if` construct as you like, but only one `else` (this should make sense if you think about it). Neither statement is required though and each use case will define how the conditions should be approached. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also note that unlike in some programming languages, in Python you do not need to spell out where the `if` condition stops, i.e. there is no `endif` statement. This is because the condition only applies to the indented lines of code. This only matters if you're familiar with other languages where an end statement is required."

    "We are slowly building up to having all the tools we need now. Now we will cover another fundamental building block of computer programmes: loops. When we want to perform a repetitive task in computing we call upon loops. There are two basic types of loop: `while` loops and a `for` loops. Each individual time the block of indented code is run is called an \"iteration\". On each iteration, the block of code inside the loop will be executed until the loop ends.\n",

The loop performs a task until the counter reaches a certain number that is equal to the total number of elements in a sequence and then ends. In reality, this is what a `for` loop is.\n",
