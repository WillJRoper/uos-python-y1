    "\n",
    "**Assessed Content**:  You need to have worked through all notebooks up to (and not including) notebook 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deadline**: August 12th at 5pm. Submit *this notebook with your solutions included* via e-submissions on Canvas. This submission has a 24 hour late period.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formatting and Commenting your code**: Your code should look neat and include comments to describe what your code does. If it isn't obvious what a line or block of code does it needs a comment. *Please use the single cell provided for each part of a question*. Some parts of your code may need higher comment density than others. Up to two marks will be deducted if your code is poorly formatted and/or poorly commented.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Collusion and Plagiarism**: By all means work together in groups, but you are expected to write your code independently. If at any time you are using \"cut and paste\" from someone else's work then you are doing something wrong and you need to stop. We have dealt with a myriad of collusion and plagirism in the past, don't add to the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Zombie codes**: One mark will be deducted if your code gets trapped in a loop and the grader has to crash out of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Avoid simple errors**: Before submitting make sure to restart and run all cells. It's easy with notebooks to accidentally delete a variable somewhere and continue using it because it is still in memory. Make sure your code still works after a restart!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Keep your files local**: This assignment requires the loading of files. You do not need to upload these files but **you do need to have them in the same directory as your notebook**. This means the file path for loading your files will always be `\"myfile.csv\"` or similar, i.e. no extra directories in the path. The markers will not move directories around to ensure your code works!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Marks**: There are 10 marks available. You can find the number of marks alloted to a question in square brackets at the end of a question. If a question relies on a previously question result which was incorrect you'll get an error carried forward and not be penalised for the error multiple times."
