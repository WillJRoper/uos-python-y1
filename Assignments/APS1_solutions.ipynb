    "## Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assessed Content**:  You need to have worked through all notebooks up to 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deadline**: Week 4, Friday at 5pm. Submit *this notebook with your solutions included* via e-submissions on Canvas.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Late-penalties**: Work handed in up to 24h late will incur a 5% penalty, i.e. 85 will be capped at 80.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Weighting**:  This is a formative assessment, i.e. has zero weight in the final grade you get for the module.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Feedback**:  A model solution will be released on Sussex Direct after the 24hr deadline. Feedback will be provided via peer marking for this assessment. If further feedback is required contact the course convenor or DT.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Release of marks**: We aim to get marks onto Sussex Direct within (and absolute maximum) of 10 working days.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Getting help**: Your primary source of help is during the Seminars in assessment week. Note that you can't skip the lab scripts and expect to be helped with the assessments.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formatting and Commenting your code**: Your code should look neat and include comments to describe what your code does. If it isn't obvious what a line or block of code does it needs a comment. *Please use the single cell provided for each part of a question*. Some parts of your code may need higher comment density than others. Up to two marks will be deducted if your code is poorly formatted and/or poorly commented.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Collusion and Plagiarism**: By all means work together in groups, but you are expected to write your code independently. If at any time you are using \"cut and paste\" from someone else's work then you are doing something wrong and you need to stop. We have dealt with a myriad of collusion and plagirism in the past, don't add to the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Zombie codes**: One mark will be deducted if your code gets trapped in a loop and the grader has to crash out of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advanced solutions**: Up to two marks will be deducted if your code uses advanced methods that have not been covered in the lab sessions. They might be clever, but you aren't demonstrating understanding (save those advanced methods for the future).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Avoid simple errors**: Before submitting make sure to restart and run all cells. It's easy with notebooks to accidentally delete a variable somewhere and continue using it because it is still in memory. Make sure your code still works after a restart!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Marks**: There are 10 marks available. You can find the number of marks alloted to a question in square brackets at the end of a question."
